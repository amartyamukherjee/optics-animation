# optics-animation

The goal of this project is to use the principles of optics (reflection, refraction et. ) to manipulate the path of an electron beam. The E&M equivalent of a ray of light getting reflected by a mirror (i.e. changing it's path to 90 degrees) is to have a magnetic field that rotates the path of the electrons by 90 degrees. We have a random distribution of electrons (basic_animation.py), which when they enter in the simulated magnetic field produced by an infinite wire with magnetic field lines coming out of the plane of the paper, change the phase of each electron by 90 degrees(simtest.py).
